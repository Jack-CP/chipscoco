# 2020  I am a student again
---
## 1. background
where am i
I was graduated three years ago from Southwest Forestry University, a engilish major. my school life is nothing special,even though,i have visited some good place and met some good people.
when i got the diploma i really gave a big sigh, it means i will make a life by myself,it means i can take control of my life,that is cool although with challenges!
not long i got a offer from SONLINK in Guangzhou,so i took my luggages and went on my way. after three months of probation it comes to a turning point of my career:
Should i keep stay at my office or just take a step to go to Kenya Africa. Ofcorse i have choosen the last one.
I`m working in Kenya about six months the first time, then i came back. I need a gap to think what a really truly want?


## 2. why i want to learn python
Nowadays you can see python everywhere,it becomes more and more popular. So i want to take a try and experisence a new way to feel the world!
someone would say:Hi good luck! and someone would say:Oh,come on!coding is too difficult,it need a lot of time.
But like i said:I wnat to take a try.
